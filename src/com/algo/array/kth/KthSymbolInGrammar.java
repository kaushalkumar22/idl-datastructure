 * On the first row, we write a 0. Now in every subsequent row, we look at the

 * Given row N and index K, return the K-th indexed symbol in row N. (The values
 * of K are 1-indexed.) (1 indexed).
 * 
 * Examples: Input: N = 1, K = 1 Output: 0
 * 
 * Input: N = 2, K = 1 Output: 0
 * 
 * Input: N = 2, K = 2 Output: 1

 * Input: N = 4, K = 5 Output: 1

	 * find the parent node until reach the first row. Then all the parent node
	 * value will be determined after the recursion function returns.
