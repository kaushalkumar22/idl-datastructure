It is an Anglo-Swiss multinational commodity and mining company with headquarters in Baar and regional Treasury Centres in London, Stamford and Singapore. It is listed on the LSE (2011) and its registered office is in St Hellier, Jersey.  Although founded in 1974 as Marc Rich + Co A/G, the current Group was formed following the merger between Glencore and Xstrata in May 2013.  Glencore’s business and EBITDA are roughly split 30% Commodity Trading and 70% Industrial Assets. \nThe Group’s strength is in its entrepreneurial style, willingness to operate in areas where others are unwilling or unable to, its product diversification and its truly global reach (the group are active in 50+ countries with 150+ assets operated by 146,000 employees). \nKey industrial products include: Copper, Cobalt, Nickel, Lead, Zinc, Ferro Alloys, Coal, Oil and Agri. These are in turn complemented by a highly integrated Marketing business connecting regions of supply with regions short on supply but long in demand. While Qatar Investment Authority is the largest investor, key members of management also retain material equity stakes in the Group."},"clientKeyObjectives":{"label":"Client’s Key Objectives/Needs","value":"The current key objective of the Group is to drive shareholder value. This is delivered through integration of upstream and marketing operations, developing and defending a strong brand and client list and delivering that through a highly centralised finance function. Managing reputational risk is a key current focus, as is migrating some of their long term debt to shorter duration to more fully match their asset/liability profile. Management have publicly committed to maintaining a strong BBB investment rating (Group was upgraded to BBB+ by S&P recently). In support of this they have provided maximum leverage targets – including max adj net debt to EBITDA of 2 times and adjusted net debt of $16Bn FCF generation. Key banking needs include substantial working capital to support the trading business, risk management on market flows as well as counterparty exposure, longer term capital markets to support industrial assets, in  region/country support around industrial assets and value adding M&A insights/advisory.","private":null},"clientStrategy":{"label":"SCB Client Relationship Aspirations & Strategy","stateList":[{"label":"Current Relationship State","value":"Mid-level Relationship"},{"label":"Desired Relationship State","value":"Regional Core Bank"}],"relationshipList":[{"label":"Relationship Strategy","value":"Our strategy assesses the addressable wallet opportunities available to SCB, relative to the capital and other costs of maintaining the relationship. Glencore’s sizeable wallet and multiple points of overlap with SCB capabilities result in it being an attractive business counterparty. However with 58 core banks (34 MLAs), we recognise the high level of competition in the market for many parts of Glencore’s Wallet. Our strategy therefore is to target specific regions/products where we believe we have meaningful operational and financial competitive positions which can in turn build sustainable and meaningful revenues with Glencore. In doing so we also ensure the client is clear on both the need to recover the cost of our investment in their RCF and which products/areas we are prioritising to achieve that.\nWe are currently prioritising the targeting of business in the following 7 areas and have messaged these relationship priorities to Glencore.\n1) Inventory finance – principally Physical Repos/LME position finance\n2) Trade Finance - Export Confirmations, OIF, Digitisation of Trade\n3) BBTLs/Receivable Services\n4) Cash management in network countries\n5) Advisory, particularly M&M and around China\n6) Shipping\n7) DCM – Asia market and investors\nAdditionally continue to work with CSDG (Corp and TB) to find alternative secondary pools of liquidity – CDS, true sale, Insurance, CLO."},{"label":"Relationship Sensitivities","value":"•Qingdoa metal fraud – Glencore and SCB both impacted.
