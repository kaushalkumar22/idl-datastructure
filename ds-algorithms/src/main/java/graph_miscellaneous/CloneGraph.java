/**
 * Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.
 *
 * Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.
 *
 * Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.
 *
 * class Node {
 *     public int val;
 *     public List<Node> neighbors;
 * }
 * Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
 * Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
 * Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
 * 1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
 * 2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
 * 3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
 * 4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
